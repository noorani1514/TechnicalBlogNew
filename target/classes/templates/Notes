Thymeleaf
You have currently written the code to render the list of posts on the webpage.
Assume that the model sent to Thymeleaf has only one post. (i.e. we have a post in the Model object with 'post' as the key)
Can you write the code to render one post on the webpage?

Suggested Answer

Here, we would not need to use th:each since we donâ€™t need to iterate over a list of posts.

<main id="post">
   <article>
   	<h2 th:text="${post.title}">Post Title</h2>
   	<div>
       	<i>Posted On</i>
       	<span th:text="${#dates.format(post.date,'dd-MMM-yyyy')}"> 22-May-2018</span>
   	</div>
   	<p class="content" th:utext="${post.body}"> Post Content</p>
   </article>
   <hr/>
</main>
